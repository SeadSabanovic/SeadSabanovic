Hi, I’m Sead — a Creative Senior Frontend Developer making users happy since 2020.

Proud to have solved complex frontend challenges for brands like BMW, Vodafone, RedBull, and Salewa, working on everything from Micro Frontends to large-scale platforms.

I specialize in delivering DRY and KISS-able code with React, Next.js, and TypeScript — clean, maintainable, and built for humans, not just machines.

I care about building products that solve real problems for real people — with purpose, value, and impact.

Take a look at my [portfolio](https://seadsabanovic.vercel.app/), and feel free to get in touch — always happy to talk code, design, or business.
